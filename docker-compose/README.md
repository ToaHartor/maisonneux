# Docker compose stacks

My personal docker compose stacks, which I used in my first infrastructure on a single server.

This folder contains the configuration and documentation I collected while refactoring my stacks, moving from nginx to Traefik, and adding a centralized authentication service with Authentik.

Users can login to Authentik with their Plex account, therefore an Authentik account is automatically created if the user has access to the Plex server selected in the config. It allows them to have access to the Plex stack with SSO (auto login on Organizr using Proxy auth, and Plex/Tautulli/Overseerr with custom scope mapping in Authentik).
However, it requires to import Plex users in Organizr, Tautulli and Overseerr.

They are also able to add a password and a two-factor authentication method to login on Plex without needing to go though the Plex pop-up.

Access to the services are configured and restricted in Authentik, as we use the _Forward auth with Single application_ proxy provider for apps having the forward auth middleware in their Traefik config, and the OIDC/OAuth2 provider for apps which have an account system.

## TO-DO List

- [x] Health checks in compose
- [ ] Finish Adguard config
- [ ] Backup setup (Kopia ?)
- [x] Migration to InfluxDB 2
- [x] Try Kavita as book server (Komga alternative)
- [ ] Docker secrets or vault usage
- [x] Use a Docker proxy for applications requiring access to `docker.sock`

## Softwares used

Strikethrough softwares are no longer part of my stacks, but the composes are still in this repository.

- All repositories mentioned above, their documentation and repository issues
- [This](https://github.com/htpcBeginner/docker-traefik) repository from htpcBeginner, which helped me a lot to understand some Traefik configuration, and from where the security policies comes.
